# Comfyui-Bot
A simply comfyui discord bot that serves as a great example for the comfyui api. Included features such as image2image and text2image. Supports the input of different resolutions. Might need a few custom nodes on comfyui(too lazy to list them out use comfyui-manager to auto manage it)

# Instructions:
1. Install Python
2. create a .env file and add your discord bot token
3. ```cd Comfyui-Bot && source .venv/bin/activate```
4. run bot5.py (you may want to change the server-address to your comfyui server)
